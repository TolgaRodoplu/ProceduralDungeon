The well awaits, an abyss profound, To swallow the tales with a solemn sound. A release from the burden, a chance to let go, Where memories and madness intermingle and flow.
In realms of lore and legends old, Where tales of power and glory unfold. Creation's symphony, a tapestry vast, Within its pages, history amassed. Of ancient beings, mighty and fair, Their struggles and triumphs, beyond compare. From Valinor's splendor to Middle-earth's strife, This chronicle weaves the tapestry of life. Elven kingdoms rise and fall, As darkness creeps, consuming all. Through silmarils, the light they seek, In Morgoth's grasp, despair grows bleak. Heroes arise, their destiny entwined, In battles fierce, their fates defined. Unearth the secrets, the hidden lore, For wisdom gained, forevermore. What tome is this, from tales so grand? Seek its pages, where enchantment stands. With noble quests and tragedies stark, Unveil its name, this timeless mark. What book am I, whose legends unfurl? A realm's creation, a treasure to unfurl.
I am a story of guilt and remorse, Of a man who committed a crime, of course. He thought he could get away with his deed, But his conscience and the law are all he'll need.
In a dystopian world, where truth is but a dream, Where Big Brother's eyes see all, or so it seems. Thoughts are crimes, and words are banned, A rebellion forms, but can it withstand?
I am a man of wealth and fame, Wrongly imprisoned, seeking revenge, not for fame. I escaped and found a hidden treasure trove, My enemies will fall, justice I will prove.
