The well awaits, an abyss profound, To swallow the tales with a solemn sound. A release from the burden, a chance to let go, Where memories and madness intermingle and flow.
In the Shire they dwell, small in stature, bold in heart, With furry feet that never part. Their homes underground, cozy and snug, In adventures, they'll join, their spirits never shrug. Who are these creatures, small and spry, With a love for second breakfast, my oh my? In Middle-earth they roam, with friendship strong, Now tell me, dear friend, who do I long?
In a dystopian land of fire and strife, Where knowledge is forbidden, the flame's rife. Books burn bright, their words erased, Ideas silenced, intellect debased. A temperature holds the secret key, To this chilling tale, now listen closely. What fiery mark does this digit bring? In literature's world, let your thoughts take wing. A number it is, of heat and dread, Its significance fills the pages unread. So tell me now, with your mind ablaze, What is this figure that sets minds ablaze?
In a dystopian world, where truth is but a dream, Where Big Brother's eyes see all, or so it seems. Thoughts are crimes, and words are banned, A rebellion forms, but can it withstand?
I am a man of wealth and fame, Wrongly imprisoned, seeking revenge, not for fame. I escaped and found a hidden treasure trove, My enemies will fall, justice I will prove.
Chess notation is K:King, Q:Queen, R:Rook, B:Bishop, N:Knight, the pawn is identified by its square. The move is represented by combining the piece identifier with the destination square. For example, Nf3 means a knight moves to the f3 square, and Bxb2 means a bishop captures a piece on b2. Captures are denoted by "x" between the piece identifier and the destination square. For example, Bxe5 means a bishop captures a piece on e5. An example game is e4 / b6 / d4 / Bb7 / Bd3 / f5 / exf5 / Bxg2 / Qh5 / g6 / fxg6 / Nf6 / gxh7 / Nxh5 / Bg6
21.03.1978 Thuesday Dear Diary, Today I saw a girl with a red baseball cap in the school. She was gorgeous. I really wanted to ask her out but I did not have the courage. So I minded my own business. Suddenly she came and sat by my side and introduced herself. Her name is Sarah and she lives so close to my home. It all happened so quickly and suddenly I now have a date with her tomorrow.
08.05.1967 Dear Diary, Today, dad took me to the library finally. When he first mensioned the library I got really excited. He said that it is where all dreams and stories and knowlage is and a beatiful place. So first time we walked in I was shocked. There was books everywhere. All sorts of books, magazines and much more. I wanted to read them all. So for the first time dad said he will choose some books for me. He picked 4 books for me. First was named The Count Of Monte Cristo. Dad said it was about a man who got betrayed and seeks revenge on his enemies. Second one was named Hobbit. Dad said it happenes in a magical fantasy world and characters go to a journey to fight a dragon. A DRAGON !!!!!. This got me so excited. The third book was named 1984 . Dad said its about a world where people can't think and say what they want. It sounds strange and scary. The fourth one was named Fahrenheit 451. Dad said that its happens in a world where reading books are forbidden and firemen burns books. Its strange. Doesn't fireman supposed to stop fires ? Anyways, we got the books and got home. I am so excited to read them all. I wanna read all the books in the library someday.
31.11.1980 Saturday Tomorrow is my first professional chess tournoment so I am very excited. Lately Im having some problems with remembering things. Sarah says I go silence for minutes or hours like thinking something. But I remember doing stuff at those times. Chess keeps my mind sharp. Helps me remember. Also I made a totem. If I win this match I will propose to Sarah. Dad always said that I can be a great chess player. This is my first step. I will take this match and this girl. Watch me dad. Now, white to play.
What did Adam and Eve do, That caused them to feel shame anew? They took the fruit that they were told to leave, And brought sin into the world with their thievery. What was this fruit that caused such a mess, And made them feel such great distress? It was the one thing they were not to eat, And now it's a story we all repeat. What was this sin that they committed, That left them feeling so ill-fitted? They disobeyed God's one command, And brought sin into the world with their own hand. So tell me now, if you can, What was the name of this fruit that began, The fall of man and all its woes, And caused them to leave the garden, so it goes?
25.09.1978 Dear Diary, Today after a very long time I again got together with Sarah I really missed her. You know that I was on a vacation with my friends. Something strange happened on vacation. We were chilling at the house after a day at the beach and suddenly I found myself in a cave trying to climb climb climb upwards. Than a man held my hand and pulled me out. I was so thankfull but than he started to hit me. He hit me so hard that I fainted I guess. I woke up in front of the house. My friend Alex woke me up. He told me that they were searching for me all over the place. My face was in bruises and blood. They insisted that I told them what happened but I couldn't tell them. How could I ? They would think I am crazy or something. I will keep this to my self for now. Anyways we met up with Sarah and tried sat down somewhere to drink something. She wore a parfume that smelled like apples. I can' remember anything smelled so good I think apples are my new favorite fruite. We meet again tomorrow.
14.07.1985 For the weekend we got to the forest with Sarah. Its been 5 years since we married we are trying to do everything we can these times because we will not have too much free time when the baby comes. 2 days ago when we were at our tent trying to sleep something poked my head throug the tent. Sarah got scared so I went out to check. It was a white rabbit. It was really cute so I wanted to catch it to show it to Sarah. I think I chased it a bit too far and got lost for about 10 hours. When I finally got back Sarah was so scared shouting my name from the tent. I did not told her what happened I did not wanted to scare her but It was a wierd night for sure.
